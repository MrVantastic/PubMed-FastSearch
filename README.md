# PubMed Fast Search
A graphical user interface program that will quickly search the entire PubMed database and return relevant publications along with their abstracts.

## Introduction
PubMed is undoubtedly the go-to database for scientific journals, abstracts, and publications. Those familiar with using the search engine know that it only displays the publication title, along with the authors. But what if you wanted to quickly read through the abstracts of each result? Look no further. PubMed Fast Search enables the user to enter keywords, specific journals, and even search a particular publish year. The program then searches the entire Database, and will generate all relevant publications along with their abstracts. There is even an option to export the search result into a text file for quick reference.

## Important

*This program was built on Python 3.6. If you have Python 2.x, the program will not work. There is also a required library called BeautifulSoup4, which should be downloaded prior to running.*
